# Web Scrapers

This is the code from my web scraping with Node.js and Puppeteer

We scrape the website https://books.toscrape.com/ but you can change the code to scrape something else.

## Node.js & Puppeteer Usage

Install dependencies

```bash
cd web-scraper-node
npm install
```

Run the file

```bash
node scrape
```
